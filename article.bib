@article{jalali_microswimmer-induced_2015,
	abstract = {Efficient mixing, typically characterised by chaotic advection, is hard to achieve in low Reynolds number conditions because of the linear nature of the Stokes equation that governs the motion. Here we show that low Reynolds number swimmers moving in quasi-periodic orbits can result in considerable stretching and folding of fluid elements. We accurately follow packets of tracers within the fluid domain and show that their trajectories become chaotic as the
        swimmer's trajectory densely fills its invariant torus. The mixing process is demonstrated in two dimensions using the Quadroar swimmer that autonomously propels and tumbles along quasi-periodic orbits with multi-loop turning trajectories. We demonstrate and discuss that the streamlines of the flow induced by the Quadroar closely resemble the oscillatory flow field of the green alga
            Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
            . Our findings can thus be utilized to understand the interactions of microorganisms with their environments, and to design autonomous robotic mixers that can sweep and mix an entire volume of complex geometry containers.},

@article{techy_optimal_2011,
	abstract = {This paper is concerned with time-optimal navigation for flight vehicles in a planar, time-varying flow-field, where the objective is to find the fastest trajectory between initial and final points. The primary contribution of the paper is the observation that in a point-symmetric flow, such as inside vortices or regions of eddie-driven upwelling/downwelling, the rate of the steering angle has to be equal to onehalf of the instantaneous vertical vorticity.
        Consequently, if the vorticity is zero, then the steering angle is constant. The result can be applied to find the time-optimal trajectories in practical control problems, by reducing the infinite-dimensional continuous problem to numerical optimization involving at most two unknown scalar parameters.},

	abstract = {The quest for the optimal navigation strategy in a complex environment is at the heart of microswimmer applications like cargo carriage or drug targeting to cancer cells. Here, we formulate a variational Fermat's principle for microswimmers determining the optimal path towards a given target regarding travelling time, energy dissipation or fuel consumption. For piecewise constant forces (or flow fields), the principle leads to Snell's law, showing that the
        optimal path is piecewise linear, as for light rays, but with a generalized refraction law. For complex environments, like general 1D, shear or vortex fields, we obtain exact analytical expressions for the optimal path, showing, for example, that microswimmers sometimes have to temporarily navigate away from their target to reach it fastest. Our results apply to idealized microswimmers which can instantaneously steer, are fast enough so that translational noise is
            unimportant and might be useful, e.g., to benchmark algorithmic schemes for optimal navigation.},

	abstract = {Abstract
        As compared to the well explored problem of how to steer a macroscopic agent, like an airplane or a moon lander, to optimally reach a target, optimal navigation strategies for microswimmers experiencing hydrodynamic interactions with walls and obstacles are far-less understood. Here, we systematically explore this problem and show that the characteristic microswimmer-flow-field crucially influences the navigation strategy required to reach a target in
            the fastest way. The resulting optimal trajectories can have remarkable and non-intuitive shapes, which qualitatively differ from those of dry active particles or motile macroagents. Our results provide insights into the role of hydrodynamics and fluctuations on optimal navigation at the microscale, and suggest that microorganisms might have survival advantages when strategically controlling their distance to remote walls.},

	abstract = {Smart active particles can acquire some limited knowledge of the fluid environment from simple mechanical cues and exert a control on their preferred steering direction. Their goal is to learn the best way to navigate by exploiting the underlying flow whenever possible. As an example, we focus our attention on smart gravitactic swimmers. These are active particles whose task is to reach the highest altitude within some time horizon, given the constraints
        enforced by fluid mechanics. By means of numerical experiments, we show that swimmers indeed learn nearly optimal strategies just by experience. A reinforcement learning algorithm allows particles to learn effective strategies even in difficult situations when, in the absence of control, they would end up being trapped by flow structures. These strategies are highly nontrivial and cannot be easily guessed in advance. This Letter illustrates the potential of
            reinforcement learning algorithms to model adaptive behavior in complex flows and paves the way towards the engineering of smart microswimmers that solve difficult navigation problems.},

In this paper we consider microswimmers in a paradigmatic three-dimensional case given by a stationary superposition of two Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flows with chaotic advection along streamlines. In such a flow, we study the evolution of point-like particles which can decide in which direction to swim, while
        keeping the velocity amplitude constant. We show that it is sufficient to endow the swimmers with a very restricted set of actions (six fixed swimming directions in our case) to have enough freedom to find efficient strategies to move upward and escape local fluid traps. The key ingredient is the learning-from-experience structure of the algorithm, which assigns positive or negative rewards depending on whether the taken action is, or is not, profitable for the
            predetermined goal in the long-term horizon. This is another example supporting the efficiency of the reinforcement learning approach to learn how to accomplish difficult tasks in complex fluid environments.},

	abstract = {To find the path that minimizes the time to navigate between two given points in a fluid flow is known as Zermelo's problem. Here, we investigate it by using a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach for the case of a vessel which has a slip velocity with fixed intensity, Vs , but variable direction and navigating in a 2D turbulent sea. We show that an Actor-Critic RL algorithm is able to find quasi-optimal solutions for both time-independent and
        chaotically evolving flow configurations. For the frozen case, we also compared the results with strategies obtained analytically from continuous Optimal Navigation (ON) protocols. We show that for our application, ON solutions are unstable for the typical duration of the navigation process, and are therefore not useful in practice. On the other hand, RL solutions are much more robust with respect to small changes in the initial conditions and to external
            noise, even when V s is much smaller than the maximum flow velocity. Furthermore, we show how the RL approach is able to take advantage of the flow properties in order to reach the target, especially when the steering speed is small.},

In such applications, robots may only have knowledge of their immediate surroundings or be faced with time-varying currents, which limits the use of optimal control techniques for planning trajectories. Here, we apply a novel Reinforcement Learning algorithm to discover time-efficient navigation policies to steer a fixed-speed
        swimmer through an unsteady two-dimensional flow field. The algorithm entails inputting environmental cues into a deep neural network that determines the swimmer's actions, and deploying Remember and Forget Experience replay. We find that the resulting swimmers successfully exploit the background flow to reach the target, but that this success depends on the type of sensed environmental cue. Surprisingly, a velocity sensing approach outperformed a bio-mimetic vorticity
            sensing approach by nearly two-fold in success rate. Equipped with local velocity measurements, the reinforcement learning algorithm achieved near 100\% success in reaching the target locations while approaching the time-efficiency of paths found by a global optimal control planner.},

	abstract = {Birds and gliders exploit warm, rising atmospheric currents (thermals) to reach heights comparable to low-lying clouds with a reduced expenditure of energy. This strategy of flight (thermal soaring) is frequently used by migratory birds. Soaring provides a remarkable instance of complex decision making in biology and requires a long-term strategy to effectively use the ascending thermals. Furthermore, the problem is technologically relevant to extend the
        flying range of autonomous gliders. Thermal soaring is commonly observed in the atmospheric convective boundary layer on warm, sunny days. The formation of thermals unavoidably generates strong turbulent fluctuations, which constitute an essential element of soaring. Here, we approach soaring flight as a problem of learning to navigate complex, highly fluctuating turbulent environments. We simulate the atmospheric boundary layer by numerical models of turbulent
            convective flow and combine them with model-free, experience-based, reinforcement learning algorithms to train the gliders. For the learned policies in the regimes of moderate and strong turbulence levels, the glider adopts an increasingly conservative policy as turbulence levels increase, quantifying the degree of risk affordable in turbulent environments. Reinforcement learning uncovers those sensorimotor cues that permit effective control over soaring in
            turbulent environments.},

Each of them is composed with a bindiny mechanism and one piece of ICPF actuator. Each tentacle can cooperate

The SMA electrified makes the internal volume shrink and the water or other aqueous medium inside the microrobot is driven backwards, thus propulsion force is formed. The moving speed and direction of the microrobot can be controlled by changing the frequency of input voltage on every SMA and ICPF actuator. The four tentacles can collaborate to realize 3 DOF movements. Experiment has been designed

	abstract = {Untethered mobile microrobots have the potential to leverage minimally invasive theranostic functions precisely and efficiently in hard-to-reach, confined, and delicate inner body sites. However, such a complex task requires an integrated design and engineering, where powering, control, environmental sensing, medical functionality, and biodegradability need to be considered altogether. The present study reports a hydrogel-based, magnetically powered and
        controlled, enzymatically degradable microswimmer, which is responsive to the pathological markers in its microenvironment for theranostic cargo delivery and release tasks. We design a doublehelical architecture enabling volumetric cargo loading and swimming capabilities under rotational magnetic fields and a 3D-printed optimized 3D microswimmer (length = 20 μm and diameter = 6 μm) using two-photon polymerization from a magnetic precursor suspension composed from
            gelatin methacryloyl and biofunctionalized superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. At normal physiological concentrations, we show that matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) enzyme could entirely degrade the microswimmer in 118 h to solubilized nontoxic products. The microswimmer rapidly responds to the pathological concentrations of MMP-2 by swelling and thereby boosting the release of the embedded cargo molecules. In addition to delivery of the drug type of
            therapeutic cargo molecules completely to the given microenvironment after full degradation, microswimmers can also release other functional cargos. As an example demonstration, anti-ErbB 2 antibody-tagged magnetic nanoparticles are released from the fully degraded microswimmers for targeted labeling of SKBR3 breast cancer cells in vitro toward a potential future scenario of medical imaging of remaining cancer tissue sites after a microswimmer-based

@article{kim_optimal_2009,
	abstract = {Simulated navigations of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) achieved by the minimum time guidance within undersea areas of current disturbances are presented. When an AUV has to transit to a given destination within an area of current disturbance, ingenious guidance enables the minimum time navigation. In this study, a numerical solution procedure for an optimal heading guidance law is developed. As the optimal heading reference, the solution of the
        optimal guidance law is fed to the heading controller. Simulated optimal navigations are realized on the basis of the dynamics of an AUV `r2D4'. The r2D4 is a deepocean-exploring AUV, developed by the Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo. The developed procedure never fails to derive the optimal heading sequence within a finite computational time, provided that the current velocity in the navigation region is known a priori. As a fail-safe strategy
            in achieving the optimal navigation, the concept of quasi-optimal navigation is presented. The quasi-optimal navigation is implemented by on-site updates of optimal guidances followed by the heading tracking control.},

@article{lucci_eulerianlagrangian_2014,
	abstract = {We study, numerically and analytically, the relationship between the Eulerian spectrum of kinetic energy, EE(k, t), in isotropic turbulence and the corresponding Lagrangian frequency energy spectrum, EL(ω, t), for which we derive an evolution equation. Our DNS results show that not only EL(ω, t) but also the Lagrangian frequency spectrum of the dissipation rate εL(ω, t) has its maximum at low frequencies (about the turnover frequency of energy-containing
            eddies) and decays exponentially at large frequencies ω (about a half of the Kolmogorov microscale frequency) for both stationary and decaying isotropic turbulence. Our main analytical result is the derivation of equations that bridge the Eulerian and Lagrangian spectra and allow the determination of the Lagrangian spectrum, EL(ω) for a given Eulerian spectrum, EE(k), as well as the Lagrangian dissipation, εL(ω), for a given Eulerian counterpart, εE(k) = 2νk2
        EE(k). These equations were derived from the Navier--Stokes equations in the sweeping-free coordinate system (intermediate between the Eulerian and Lagrangian frameworks) which eliminates the effect of the kinematic sweeping of the small eddies by the larger eddies. We show that both analytical relationships between EL(ω) and EE(k) and between εL(ω) and εE(k) are in very good quantitative agreement with our DNS results and explain how εL(ω, t) has its maximum at
        low frequencies and decays exponentially at large frequencies.},

@article{peters_effects_2000,
	abstract = {From the literature we obtained experimental data on the effects of small-scale turbulence on plankton at the organism scale. Normalized rates in response to turbulence were calculated in the present study for parameters related to growth, ingestion and energy expenditure. Growth rates are, in general, negatively affected by turbulence. Nevertheless, the data are highly biased towards a specific group of organisms, dinoflagellates, which could have
        peculiar physiological impediments under turbulence. Ingestion rates seem to be increased by turbulence, especially at low and intermediate levels. The few data available on energy expenditure indicate increases under turbulent conditions. Although many experiments were conducted at very high levels of turbulence with respect to oceanic conditions, in most studies the Kolmogorov size microscale remained larger than the size of the planktonic organisms. Thus,
        organisms responded to turbulence or turbulence-derived stimuli below the Kolmogorov lengthscale. The ecological relevance of interactions between turbulence and other sizerelated parameters, such as reactive distances, mean free paths and Batchelor microscales, are mentioned mainly in terms of predation, nutrient uptake and competition. Specifically, mean free paths seem relevant to determine encounter rates for organisms that show concentrations similar to
            those typical for large protozoa and algae (both within these organisms and between them and their potential predators). Characteristic time scales for different planktonic organisms are also explored in relation to the corresponding Kolmogorov time microscale. All planktonic organisms will experience fluctuations in the nutrient or food-particle fields over their lifetime. If other characteristic times are considered, such as the time between particle
            capture or nutrient uptake events, fluctuations may or may not be experienced over those times depending on the feeding mode and the turbulence intensity.},
